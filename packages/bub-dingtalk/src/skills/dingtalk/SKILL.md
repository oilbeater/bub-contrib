# DingTalk Skill

When the message context contains `$dingtalk` and `chat_id`, you are in a DingTalk conversation.

## Primary: Return Your Response Directly

**To reply to a DingTalk user, simply return your response as text.** The framework will automatically deliver it to the correct conversation. No script call is required.

- The `chat_id` from the message context is used automatically.
- Just write your answer and end the turn. The user will receive it.

Example: User asks "What is 2+2?" → You return "4" → The framework sends "4" to DingTalk.

## When to Use the Script

Use `dingtalk_send` only when you need to send **from within a tool** (e.g. a progress update during a long-running task, or a status message triggered by another tool).

```bash
uv run ./scripts/dingtalk_send.py --chat-id <CHAT_ID> --content "<TEXT>"
```

Get `chat_id` from the message context JSON (the `chat_id` field). For group chats it is `group:<openConversationId>`, for 1:1 it is the user's staff_id.

## Context Fields

When `$dingtalk` is in scope, the message context typically includes:

- `channel`: `$dingtalk` — identifies this as a DingTalk conversation
- `chat_id`: target for sending (e.g. `204818006723348842` for 1:1, or `group:xxx` for groups)

## Response Policy

- **Direct answers**: Return your response. The framework delivers it.
- **Long-running tasks**: Return a short acknowledgment first (e.g. "Working on it..."), then continue. When done, return the final result.
- **Errors**: Return an error message so the user sees it immediately.

## Script Reference (for programmatic use)

```bash
uv run ./scripts/dingtalk_send.py \
  --chat-id <CHAT_ID> \
  --content "<TEXT>" \
  [--title "<TITLE>"]
```

- `--chat-id`, `-c`: required
- `--content`, `-m`: required
- `--title`, `-t`: optional, default "Bub Reply"
